# darts !
# as a user so that we can start the game I am given 501 points
# as a user, I want to throw 3 darts for each turn
# as a user to win we need to reach strictly 0 from an even number up to 40# darts

# (needs a new method for when @points is less than 40, where only one dart is thrown at a time, rather than 3, so that it's easier to finish - real darts finishes when one dart gets the double, rather than the sum of three darts)
